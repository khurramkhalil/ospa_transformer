# Orthogonal Subspace Projection Attention (OSPA)

This repository contains the implementation of **Orthogonal Subspace Projection Attention (OSPA)**, a novel transformer architecture that enforces orthogonality constraints between attention heads to improve representation quality and computational efficiency.

## Overview

OSPA is a fundamental rethinking of how attention mechanisms distribute their representational capacity across multiple heads. Unlike standard multi-head attention where heads may redundantly model the same information, OSPA decomposes the embedding space into mutually orthogonal subspaces, ensuring each attention head operates in its own disentangled segment of the representation space.

Key innovations include:
- **Orthogonal projection matrices** for queries, keys, and values
- **Structured attention head specialization** through subspace decomposition
- **Improved gradient flow** and numerical stability via orthogonal transformations

## Usage

### Training

OSPA can be trained on various NLP tasks. Here's an example of training on a GLUE benchmark task:

```bash
python src/scripts/train.py \
    --task sst2 \
    --d_model 512 \
    --nhead 8 \
    --num_layers 6 \
    --enforce_mode regularize \
    --ortho_penalty_weight 0.01 \
    --batch_size 32 \
    --learning_rate 5e-5 \
    --epochs 3
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python src/scripts/evaluate.py \
    --task sst2 \
    --model_path experiments/sst2_regularize_20250319-120000/best_model.pt \
    --batch_size 32
```

### Analyzing Attention Patterns

Visualize and analyze attention patterns:

```bash
python src/scripts/analyze_attention.py \
    --model_path experiments/sst2_regularize_20250319-120000/best_model.pt \
    --input_text "This is a sample text to analyze attention patterns."
```

## Benchmarks

## OSPA Variants

OSPA supports multiple modes for enforcing orthogonality:

1. **regularize**: Uses an orthogonality penalty during training
2. **strict**: Directly enforces orthogonality in the forward pass
3. **init**: Only initializes weights orthogonally

Each variant offers different trade-offs between performance and computational efficiency.

## Analysis Tools

The repository includes several tools for analyzing OSPA's behavior:

- **Orthogonality Measurement**: Quantify how orthogonal projection matrices are across layers
- **Attention Pattern Visualization**: Visualize attention patterns to understand how heads specialize
- **Head Specialization Analysis**: Measure the degree of specialization in different attention heads
- **Subspace Comparison**: Compare attention subspaces between OSPA and standard transformers
- **Performance Profiling**: Analyze computational efficiency and memory usage

## How OSPA Works

### Mathematical Foundation

OSPA builds on the insight that the representational capacity of multi-head attention can be better utilized by enforcing orthogonality constraints. 

In standard multi-head attention, the input embedding $X$ is projected to queries ($Q$), keys ($K$), and values ($V$) using learned projection matrices:

$Q_i = XW_i^Q, \quad K_i = XW_i^K, \quad V_i = XW_i^V$

OSPA modifies these projections by enforcing that the projection matrices for different heads span orthogonal subspaces:

$W_i^Q (W_j^Q)^T = 0, \quad W_i^K (W_j^K)^T = 0, \quad W_i^V (W_j^V)^T = 0 \quad \text{for } i \neq j$

This orthogonality constraint ensures that different heads attend to different aspects of the input, reducing redundancy and improving the model's representational capacity.

### Implementation Details

OSPA can be implemented in several ways:

1. **Orthogonality Regularization**: Add an orthogonality penalty to the loss function
   ```python
   loss = task_loss + ortho_penalty_weight * model.get_orthogonality_penalty()
   ```

2. **Strict Orthogonalization**: Apply Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization during the forward pass
   ```python
   # In forward pass
   self.weight = orthogonalize(self.weight)
   ```

3. **Orthogonal Initialization**: Initialize projection matrices to be orthogonal
   ```python
   nn.init.orthogonal_(self.weight)
   ```

## Performance Considerations

OSPA offers several performance benefits:

- **Improved Gradient Flow**: Orthogonal transformations preserve gradient norms during backpropagation
- **Better Optimization Dynamics**: Reduced redundancy leads to more efficient parameter updates
- **Potential for Computational Optimization**: Block-diagonal structure could be exploited for faster computation

## Future Directions

Several promising directions for future research include:

1. **Adaptive Orthogonality**: Dynamically adjusting the degree of orthogonality based on task demands
2. **Sparse Orthogonal Projections**: Combining sparsity with orthogonality for even more efficient attention
3. **Orthogonal Latent Attention (OLA)**: Extending OSPA with latent attention mechanisms
4. **Hardware-Aware Orthogonal Projections**: Optimizing the implementation for specific hardware accelerators
